# Node.js Testing Instructions

How the service is structured is owned by the installed Node.js Express instructions. This file owns Jest files under `tests/` only.

## Shared

- Start every test file with the `/** @jest-environment node */` docblock.
- Use native ESM (`import` / `export`). Relative imports **MUST** include the `.js` extension.
- Source at `src/<path>/<filename>.js` → test at `tests/<path>/<filename>.test.js`. Mirror `src/`; do not invent a parallel layout.
- Run tests in the service container (same as `npm test` / project test script), not against a host-only Node that lacks service deps.
- Exclude `src/server.js` (not `src/app.js`) from Jest `collectCoverageFrom`.
- Group tests in `describe` blocks. Use `it("should ...")`. Prefer `toEqual()` / `toStrictEqual()` over loose assertions.
- Never perform real network I/O or live database connections.
- Reset mocks in `beforeEach` (`jest.clearAllMocks()` or `jest.resetAllMocks()`).

## Which section

- `src/routes/**` (and the matching `tests/routes/**` file) → **HTTP API tests**.
- Every other `src/` module → **Unit tests**.
- Do not mix styles in one file. Do not use Supertest outside `tests/routes/`. Do not test a router by importing its exports and calling them as functions.

## Unit tests

Apply to utils, services, middlewares, entities, jobs, controllers, and other non-route modules.

- Use **Jest** only (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `jest.fn()`, `jest.spyOn()`). Do not import `supertest` or `src/app.js`.
- Import the module under test and call its exports directly.
- Mock that module's external collaborators (other services, DB helpers, outbound HTTP, clocks). Do not mock the function you are asserting on.
- Assert return values, thrown errors, and calls into mocked collaborators.

## HTTP API tests

Apply to Express route modules (`src/routes/<resource>.js`).

- Use **Supertest** (`supertest(app)`) plus Jest assertions. Import `src/app.js` (the assembled app, no `listen()`), not `src/server.js`. App vs entry-point assembly is owned by the Node.js Express instructions.
- Drive the full route stack over HTTP (`GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE`). Assert status, headers, and JSON body.
- Mock database operations and outbound HTTP at the boundary. Do not mock the router file, `src/app.js`, or the middlewares that route actually wires.
- Cover happy path, validation failures, auth/ACL denials the route enforces, and error-handler responses the stack actually produces.
